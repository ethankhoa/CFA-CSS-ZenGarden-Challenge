# CFA CSS ZenGarden Challenge

### Objective
The goal of this challenge was to make our own CSS file for the CSS Zen Garden Challenge. We were challenged to keeping to the Zen Garden rules of not altering the HTML and writing our own CSS without the use of bootstrap or other frameworks.

## Result

The end result is a mix of some triumph. I was able to flip the content horizontal via a series of translates.

Ongoing issue that I want to update is the improve the box layouts and its responsiveness. 

## Difficulties
This was hard mainly because the HTML and structure wasn't as straight forward as I expected. I bit off more than I could chew by choosing to try to change the page to a horizontal layout.
